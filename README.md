# MPL3115A2-Library
The aim of this project is to create a weather station that will consist of an LCD display and a pressure sensor MPL3115A2.

The MPL3115A2 sensor is controlled via the I2C bus. This bus consists of only two lines: the data line (marked as SDA, serial data) and the line of the transmission clock (marked as SCL, serial clock). These two lines carry all information: data, addresses and control signals.
